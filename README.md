# general-loot-finder
general purpose cuda loot finder

will write a proper README eventually, in the meantime if you need help using this, just ping me (@scriptline) in the Minecraft@Home Discord server. If you are reading this a few months from now, there is a good chance this repo is obsolete and you should just use https://github.com/Kludwisz/Lootinator
